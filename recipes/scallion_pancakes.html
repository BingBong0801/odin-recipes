        <h2>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions (green onions)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li><br>
            <li>Slowly add the boiling water to the flour mixture, stirring with chopsticks or a wooden spoon until a rough dough forms.</li><br>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li><br>
            <li>Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into a thin, round pancake (about 8 inches in diameter).</li><br>
            <li>Brush the top of each pancake with vegetable oil and sprinkle with sliced scallions.</li><br>
            <li>Roll up each pancake tightly, jelly-roll style, and then coil each roll into a spiral shape, tucking the end underneath.</li><br>
            <li>Use a rolling pin to flatten each spiral into a thin pancake (about 1/4 inch thick).</li><br>
            <li>Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.</li><br>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add a pancake to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy.</li><br>
            <li>Remove the pancake from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to cool.</li><br>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining pancakes, adding more oil to the pan as needed.</li><br>
            <li>Serve the scallion pancakes warm, cut into wedges, with soy sauce or another dipping sauce of your choice.</li><br>
